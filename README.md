## Running

To set the duration of time between produced messages, you must 
set a `service_delay=5000` environment variable in your given environment.
Delay is set in millisecond, 5000 is equal to 5 seconds.

You also must be running a RabbitMQ broker instance, either locally or in a docker.
This service is hardcoded to emit to `my-exchange`// `power.queue`.

To start the web server for the application, run:

    lein run 

You should see messages being produced to the specified queue in your RabbitMQ console.
